Darren - Unity software and programming work

Alex - reflections and online Hardware planning

Tasin - Hardware implementation

The goal of this project was to create a unique way of playing Patapon using motion imputs from an accelerometer.

We first created a prototype online using Wokwi to test the inputs.

Then using this as a base we created a prototype to test the inputs.

Using this as a base we recreated this with the physical hardware that we had

To replicate the mechanics of patapon, we recorded each direction of the accelerometer as a unique number, using these numbers we could record the last 4 inputs, and if they matched a predetermined pattern, it would call a variable. 

When testing with the physical model we ran into an issue, the accelerometer was broken and not recording any inputs, this made it impossible to continue with the project as we had no way of recording our inputs.
